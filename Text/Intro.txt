Welcome 
Signal world                              Envelop world
------------ ( ready nightly version)     ------------
(little dev no ai)                        full dev heavy ai 
a complete computational model with: 
  a digital → analog → sinusoidal bridge

  built on Goldbach-style rhythmic grouping
  (2,3,5) 

  with step-function geometry and

  P.Fraundorf-compatible matrices and ultimately,
  a character-encoding → FFT → matrix representation 

  → machine-learning compatible embedding.
