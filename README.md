# FFT-Sinoid_Computer
a complete computational model with:  a digital → analog → sinusoidal bridge  built on Goldbach-style rhythmic grouping (2,3,5)  with step-function geometry  and P.Fraundorf-compatible matrices  and ultimately, a character-encoding → FFT → matrix representation → machine-learning compatible embedding.  a new type of computer?

##### Intro
the vowel program is fully parameterized with your updated prime‑factor encodings. Let’s consolidate what you’ve done and show how to run the first full learning pass across A, E, I, O, U.

##### general summary
Set oand tune the stepped function and the sinoid. The amplitude is set to 12 by stMu2(x) := stepFu(x,12); This fits into the Frauendorf 2d level in the fourier visuial provided. This is not a choice of pure logic more a step of try and error seing what happens. I believe there are not many humans that could do that steps in their head without having it to write down. Thats why i just tried. lists and matrices(LnMax) functions is my attempt to bridge from Fraundorf to goldbach conjecture. Wher I took reverse steps starting with the 4x4 matrix and retraced it in way it fits with goldbach. This more an engineering attempt because the steps taken where a neccassity to make it work rather than an mathematical proof. So define(yo(t), ratsimp(imagpart(LnMax(%i*t)))); links to the reverse fft and is the first path taken here. LN4: Lnopqr(1); LN3: Lnopq(1); LN2: Lnop(1); LN1: Lno(1); finally achieves the 4x4 Fraundorf . "certain points" inserts data points into a structure. As it turns out it delives intersection points to our key = "fe where y=1 -> 2^1, y=2 -> 4x4, fe where y=4 -> 8x8" Faundorf link and the chars. If we where literally meassuring currants and voltages in a real device that make use of all of this system described here there is the question waether to normalize all to just allow for y > 0 as we are only intersted into x > 0 for now. But this might not be so important andcan be adjusted alteron. Lets focus on your 'Learning system' as you can see the vowel e and i are a very symetric structure and both are the bedrock for language. So we have defined fourier influenced system to describe language itself but we are dealing with a functional level and sinoids not with chars anymore, but yes all code can be put into this, would be very interesting to start learning algos from here.


##### detail wxmaxima
newer older wrong "A" = char 65 -> 5*13 -> charA "e" = char 65 -> 5*13 -> charE "E" = char 69 -> 3*23 -> charE "i" = char 69 -> 3*23 -> charI "I" = char 73 -> 1*73 -> charI "O" = char 79 -> 1*79 -> charO "U" = char 85 -> 5*17 -> charU this was a comment now wxmaxima code : mCP: string_to_octets("AEIOU", "cp1252"); and here the updated chars : charA(x) := (sin((5/6)*x)*sin((13/6)*x))*6; charE(x) := (sin((3/6)*x)*sin((23/6)*x))*6; charI(x) := (sin((1/6)*x)*sin((73/6)*x))*6; charO(x) := (sin((1/6)*x)*sin((79/6)*x))*6; charU(x) := (sin((5/6)*x)*sin((17/6)*x))*6;

a step function that defines a positive value where x and  y > 0 another stepped function that shall be an upper boundry of a graph that looks like the analog activation curve of a transistor, so to graphs upper (digital) and analog ones e.g (an analog graph) explicit(stepFu(x,6),x,-10,67), key   = "fs : a computed element that can be plug into a Ln.. function",    Certain point are calculated intersections of graphs The six is computationall yimportant because it refers to the 6th step when counting the groups in our Goldbach groups strategy.  So now there is a whole system capable of visiualizing/representing number from natural to complex and ffts that connect digital with step funnctions to analog to real or sinusoidal functions. The basic metrics are Frauendorf conform lists amd matrices. This all is very nice but further down there is the attempt to visiualize/enter chars into this system. That what the next 2d plot is about. Here we start with the char encodeing of wxmaxima(lisp?) and use our Frauendorf metrices and step function with periodic variables( make them periodic) there is the fst attempt ot start with the vowels a e i o u. This could be a very interesting approach to any machien learning as well because all chars and therefore code can be put into this form. We have basically a software for an unbuild computer that runs very differently and the a e i ou is the first program.
