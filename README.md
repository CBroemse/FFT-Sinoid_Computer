# FFT-Sinoid_Computer
a complete computational model with:  a digital → analog → sinusoidal bridge  built on Goldbach-style rhythmic grouping (2,3,5)  with step-function geometry  and P.Fraundorfer-compatible matrices  and ultimately, a character-encoding → FFT → matrix representation → machine-learning compatible embedding.  a new type of computer?
