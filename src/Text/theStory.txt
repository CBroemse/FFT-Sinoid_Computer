The importance of the YBand                                                                                  When I wrote this wohle system I was playing in my mind.
 I was an imaginative scientist who build a device to make
 a harddrive out of any rock and a computer out of any crystal
 by shining light through the crystal from various angles in the device.
 The device works well but now we are confronted with the problem
 to calibrate a computer system into that crystals inherit structure.
 We have to come up with a system that represents the refracting
 light inside a perfect crystal and further down if to which degree
 a not perfect crystal can do that, if possible at all. This sinoid
 computer is one approach of a bigger file called stelsel that is
 like the provided one 
    main file 'FFT-Sinoid_Computer.wxmx'
 just very more detailed. I first longed to generate natural numbers
 as one of the premisses to the desired system.
 That is done via our Goldbach system. Next we want to establish chars
 and special signs. This is this very step. There is a hard construction
 and design problem
 that is a) how long keep the level (make shure our sinoid stays up where it
 is in the model) up where it is and how this will be achieved if we are
 dealing with damped oscillations (which is a physical trait of reality).
 We could say , no damped oscillation, but that would limit the system and
 maybe make other decisions unreachable further down. Hence I opted for
 undamped in the first step and damped as snd . This YBoundry is our specially
 build damped oscillator that we can apply to all sinoids to specify
 messeruments and time.  b) This relates somehow to the next challange that
 is to sequentially write letter like in 'hello world' and finally to being
 able to retrieve letter from sinoids so to go reverse.
